# Spurious_Multivariate
Codes for the Monte Carlo analysis in "Spurious multivariate regressions under fractionally integrated processes"

For readibility, the codes are not optimized
We suggest to read first "spurious_mult_finite_sample_stationary_sum_below_half"
It is the one fully documented. The rest follow the same structure
